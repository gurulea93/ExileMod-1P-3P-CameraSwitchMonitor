## ExileMod-1P-3P-CameraSwitchMonitor
#### by [midgetgrimm]

Again, made for Exile, but can easily be adapted. Basically, locks you to 1P view in combat, or in general, if not in combat, you get a 3 second look in 3P. If driving or building you can also use 3P unless put into combat, then locks to 1P

* Keeps player in 1st person unless driving or building, 
* Plus gives a 3 second check camera if not in combat to view gear and what not..
* If in Combat, straight to 1st person
* Also script wont run if you set it to hardcore, this is so you can keep group settings and some leniency

###Install:

`[]execVM "fn_switchCamera.sqf";`

Put in init.sqf or initPlayerLocal.sqf

Сделано для Exile, но может быть легко адаптирован. Включает вид от 1 лица во время боя, если не в бою вы получаете вид от 3 лица.
